### Application.App.java 
> The JRE's windowing subsystem, via **SwingUtilities.invokeLater()**, starts 3 threads at a time:
"AWT-Windows" (daemon thread), "AWT-Shutdown" and "AWT-EventQueue-0".
The "AWT-EventQueue-0" is known as the Event-Dispatching Thread (EDT),
which is the one and only thread responsible for handling all the events (such as clicking of buttons)
and refreshing the display to ensure thread safety in GUI operations and manipulating GUI components.
